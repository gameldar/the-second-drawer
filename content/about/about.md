Welcome to the Second Drawer, or at least the latest incarnation of it.

This is a light-weight blog designed as a place to create, store and share learnings as I come across them.
This will likely be quite an eclectic collection of things like you typically find in the second drawer of your kitchen.
In mine I have everything from measuring cups, to spatulas, to random tools that came with some fad kitchen appliance.
In this blog you'll likely find a similar eclectic collection of things, probably with a computing/programming bent.
